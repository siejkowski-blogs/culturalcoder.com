  cite: These days I seem to be forming the view that the only good metaphor of software development is a dead one.

  cite: "So, what is Software Craftsmanship then? In a very simplistic way, we can say that software craftsmanship is a better metaphor for software development than software engineering. Software craftsmanship sees software as a craft and compares software developers to medieval blacksmiths."

  cite: "Over the years, I joined some of these debates and spent a lot of energy trying to convince people why Software Craftsmanship is a good metaphor and why software development is a craft. As I was getting more involved with it, I realised that it does not really matter. This is by far the least important thing we should be discussing. I personally like the metaphor and treat software development as a craft but what I really find important and care about are the values that Software Craftsmanship tries to promote."

  cite: "The phrase ‘software engineering’ was deliberately chosen as being provocative, in implying the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering."

  cite: "The software industry is not industrialized. We undoubtedly produce software by backward techniques. We undoubtedly get the short end of the stick in confrontations with hardware people because they are the industrialists and we are the crofters. Software production today appears in the scale of industrialization somewhere below the more backward construction industries. I think its proper place is considerably higher, and would like to investigate the prospects for mass-production techniques in software."

  cite: "You do plan. You plan you're going to make a plot this big. You're going to prepare the soil. You bring in a landscape person who says to put the big plants in the back and short ones in the front. You've got a great plan, a whole design. But when you plant the bulbs and the seeds, what happens? The garden doesn't quite come up the way you drew the picture. This plant gets a lot bigger than you thought it would. You've got to prune it. You've got to split it. You've got to move it around the garden. This big plant in the back died. You've got to dig it up and throw it into the compost pile. These colors ended up not looking like they did on the package. They don't look good next to each other. You've got to transplant this one over to the other side of the garden."
