Bill Laboon: How Would Plato Program? : The Ethics of Software Engineering
@BillLaboon

We all want to write good software... but what does it mean for software to be "good"? If you ask a CEO, an open-source developer, and a computer science professor, you'll get very different answers. We'll take a guided tour of the history of ethical thought and apply it to software development in order to understand how others have defined it, and perhaps help to develop your own ethical framework. Along the way, we'll answer questions such as: What would Nietzsche say about malware developers? How are contracting companies like Moses? Would Kant write closed-source software?
